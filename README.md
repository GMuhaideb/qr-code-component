# QR Code Component

Welcome to the QR Code Component project! This is an excellent opportunity for beginners who are new to HTML and CSS. If you're just starting out and want to dip your toes into web development, you've come to the right place. In this project, you'll be creating a simple QR code component with a fixed card layout. This means you won't have to worry about responsive design for now.

## Project Overview

The QR Code Component project is designed to help you get comfortable with basic HTML and CSS concepts. You'll be creating a card that displays a QR code. The card layout will be static, which means it won't shift or adapt to different screen sizes. This makes it a perfect project if you haven't yet delved into the world of responsive web design.

## Goals

Your main goals in this project are:

1. **Create the Card Layout:** Build the basic structure of the card using HTML. You'll need to include elements for the QR code and any accompanying text.

2. **Style the Card:** Apply CSS to make the card visually appealing. You can experiment with colors, fonts, and other styling properties.

3. **Generate a QR Code:** Research how to generate a QR code using a library or an online tool. Embed the generated QR code image into the card.

4. **Add Text:** Include a brief description or a title for the QR code. This could be a placeholder text for now.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine. You can use Git or simply download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Open the Project:** Use your preferred code editor to open the project folder. You'll find two main files: `index.html` and `styles.css`.

3. **HTML Structure:** Begin by setting up the basic HTML structure in the `index.html` file. Create the necessary elements for the card layout, such as a container for the QR code image and a text element for the description.

4. **CSS Styling:** Move on to the `styles.css` file to add styles to your HTML elements. Experiment with colors, fonts, borders, and other properties to make the card visually appealing.

5. **Generate QR Code:** Research how to generate a QR code. You can use online tools or libraries for this purpose. Once you have the QR code image, embed it into the HTML structure you created earlier.

6. **Add Text:** Include a placeholder title or description for the QR code. This will help you practice adding text to your project.

7. **Preview and Test:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see how your QR code component looks. Make adjustments to the HTML and CSS as needed.

8. **Share Your Work:** Once you're satisfied with your QR code component, consider sharing it with friends or on social media. It's a great way to showcase your progress and get feedback.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the QR Code Component project! By finishing this project, you've gained hands-on experience with HTML and CSS. You've created a simple but visually appealing component that displays a QR code.
